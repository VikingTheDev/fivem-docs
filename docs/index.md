# Welcome!

Welcome to the documentation for all my publicly released FiveM scripts/resources.

## About

All my scripts are written in JavaScript or TypeScript. All my scripts are written solely by myself, unless something else is specifed. In that case I will credit the orignal author and describe what I've changed.

This site is still in development, I'm in the process of updating all my scripts and releasing them so documentation will be added for each script as I finish them. Previous public releases that are missing documentation will also be added.

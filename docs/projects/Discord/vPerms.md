## General
vPerms is a real time permission system utilizting [vDiscord](https://github.com/VikingTheDev/vDiscord). The script was originally created by SpaceTheDev ([forums](https://forum.cfx.re/u/space_man), [github](https://github.com/SpaceTheDev)), so if you enjoy the script please show him some love. The only changes I have made to the script is adding some additional customizability in terms of the role hierarchy (adding subcategories), and making some minor changes to make it work with `vDiscord`. Check out the original release [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-sperms-real-time-discord-perms/1686063).

The script is event based, meaning that it allows for real-time roles (no need for relogging or restarting the server for perms to update!). The perms are based on discord roles.
